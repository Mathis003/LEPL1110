- **Institution**: Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain)

## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Finite Elements project for the LEPL1110 course at UCLouvain. The project is divided into three main components: the preprocessor, the processor, and the postprocessor. These components are designed to generate, solve, and analyze finite element models, particularly focused on structures like bridges.
