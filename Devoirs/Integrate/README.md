### Instructions to Compile this Homework (Integrate)

## To compile this homework, follow these steps:

# 1. Create Build Directory:
Create a directory named `build` with the command `mkdir build`.

# 2. Run CMake:
Navigate into the `build` directory and run `cmake ..`.

# 3. Compile and Execute:
Run `make` inside the `build` directory to compile the project.
Finally, run `./myFem` to execute the compiled program.

## Error Handling:
If an error occurs during the compilation process, you can follow these steps to resolve it:

# 1. Delete Build Directory:
If an error occurs, it's often helpful to start fresh by deleting the build directory. Use the following command to remove the build directory: `rm -rf build`

# 2. Retry Compilation:
Once the `build` directory has been removed, you can attempt the compilation process again by following the previous instructions.

By removing the `build` directory, you can eliminate any potential conflicts or issues that may have arisen during the compilation process.
